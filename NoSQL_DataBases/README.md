# Working with NoSQL Databases like Redis, Neo4j, and MongoDB for data analytics

In this project, I've worked with different NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Redis, Cassandra, and Neo4j for asked queries and data analysis.

## MongoDB
Queries for crawled data from Isna and Irna which are news Agencies in Iran.

## Redis
Queries for crawled data from Isna and Irna which are news Agencies in Iran.

## Cassandra
Queries for IMDB dataset. As we don't have joins in Cassandra, I've created a special table for each requested query and after loading the table's data, I applied each requested query.

## Neo4j
After creating Nodes for each dataset of an online shop, I've written queries in `Cypher` to extract relevant data from created graphs for each query.
